# Girls Who Code at UNC Charlotte
This is the official website for Girls Who Code at UNC Charlotte *(until the full one is developed with our Web Dev Team)*. 
# 
##### This website was built with a template used in one of our workshops!

#### If you're interested in trying to build your own online portfolio with this template, you can see the guide for the workshop here:
